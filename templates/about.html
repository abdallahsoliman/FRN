                    Our mission is to fight waste and feed people.
                    We do this by donating the excess food from campus to our community.
                    In addition to diverting food waste, we hold educational events on campus and in the community about
                    issues regarding social inequality, healthy eating, food waste, and ethical service practices.
                    We also work closely with other food and service related groups to connect multiple student
                    organizations together through Food Forum.
